Thank you for choosing to test my coursework.

Windows 10 is required to run this program

In order to play, please run "Jario.exe".
Your OS and Antiviruses will attempt to prevent it from running,
however the program is not a virus so take steps to run the program regardless.

Proceed through the menu as you wish, and click "play" or "host" when you are ready.
Move with WASD or the mouse if you enabled it.
Use spacebar to create a sub-blob.


IMPORTANT:
If you are on a different network to another person, you will likely be unable to play together.
